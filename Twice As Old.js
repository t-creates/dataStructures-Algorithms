Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

// Solution #0
function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  return Math.abs(sonYearsOld - (dadYearsOld - sonYearsOld));
}

// Solution #1
function twiceAsOld1(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  return Math.abs(dadYearsOld - (2 * sonYearsOld));
}
